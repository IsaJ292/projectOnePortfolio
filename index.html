           <h2>Some things about Isa is that she loves exploring the city and this picture in 
            the top right corner is from a time when her and her roommates went to the beach at
            night to light sparklers and fireworks. Isa is originally from the Central Valley, 
            from a small town called Waterford and left at the age of 18 for college and has since
             lived in SF. Currently majoring in Industrial Design, Isa enjoys the ability to be 
             creative in the workplace compared to when she was a Computer Science Major. Unlike 
             her hometown, city life is a big jump and is one that she really loves. A lot of people 
             love to hate the city and its bad factors, but Isa loves the amount of opportunity the 
             city provides people who look for it. There are endless possibilities, and she finds it
              kind of crazy how good public transportation is here contrary to Waterford. Other things
               about Isa is that she has a deep love for matcha and tends to make her own lattes at 
               home since there are very few places that she finds are of good quality in the Bay 
               Area. Isa has a fear of dogs, mainly bigger ones nowadays but has had many cats throughout
                her life. Currently she has two cats, one named Kitty who is 7 years old and one named
                 Michi who is 5 months old. Her goal after graduation is to travel the world before 
                 settling down. She eventually wants to get an apartment in the city, get a Shiba Inu
                 and a cat, and then ideally work as a Industrial Designer for Apple or at a smaller 
                 design firm. In the end she hopes she can become a meaningful designer that is able 
                 to provide for her immigrant parents who gave it there all to send her to college
                  and to her older sister who supported her the whole time.</h2>
